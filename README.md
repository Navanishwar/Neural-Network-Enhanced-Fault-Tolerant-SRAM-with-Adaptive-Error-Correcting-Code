Introduction

This repository contains multiple projects focused on FPGA design, digital circuits, and neural networks. It serves as a resource for engineers and researchers interested in these domains.

Technology Used

Xilinx Vivado - FPGA design and implementation

Logisim Evolution - Digital circuit simulation

Python - For neural network project

TensorFlow, NumPy - Required libraries for machine learning applications

Microsoft PowerPoint - Presentation documentation

Overview

Below is a brief description of the key components:

1. Fault Detection Circuit (Fault_cmplt.circ)

A Logisim-based circuit designed for fault detection in digital systems.

2. 8-Bit SRAM FPGA Implementation (8BitSRAMfpga/)

This directory contains FPGA design files for an 8-bit SRAM implementation. It includes:

Project files (.xpr) for FPGA tools

Cache, IP, and run directories related to synthesis and implementation

3. Neural Network Project (ProjectNeuralNetwork/)

A machine learning-based project for neural network applications.

4. Presentation (Complete_PPT.pptx)

A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project details and implementation steps, intended for stakeholders and developers.

Setup Instructions

To work with these projects, follow these steps:

For FPGA-based Design (8BitSRAMfpga)

Open Xilinx Vivado or the appropriate FPGA tool.

Load the .xpr project file.

Run synthesis and implementation steps as required.

For Logisim Circuit (Fault_cmplt.circ)

Install Logisim Evolution.

Open the .circ file and analyze/debug the circuit.

For Neural Network Project

Navigate to the ProjectNeuralNetwork directory.

Ensure you have Python installed along with required libraries listed in requirements.txt (numpy, tensorflow, etc.). You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the neural network script (if provided).

Usage

Analyze the Fault Detection Circuit using Logisim.

Modify and implement the 8-bit SRAM FPGA design.

Train and evaluate the Neural Network Model using Python.

Refer to the Presentation for project insights.

Important Notes

Ensure all required software and dependencies are installed before running any project.

For FPGA design, verify compatibility with the required FPGA board.

The neural network project requires a properly configured Python environment.

Review the PPT presentation for a high-level project overview before implementation.
